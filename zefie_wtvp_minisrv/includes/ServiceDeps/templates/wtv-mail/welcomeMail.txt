Thank you for test driving minisrv! 

minisrv aims to provide a simular experience as the production WebTV Services.
You can enjoy fun features as they are released, such as WebTV Mail, WebTV Chat, Usenet, customing your <a href="wtv-setup:/mail-signature">signature settings</a> which also support custom HTML abilities. 

You can use Mail to send internal email to others by emailing <b>theirusername@${service_name}</b>, replacing "theirusername" with the user's actual username.
Others within the same minisrv network can also email you by sending a message to <b>${user_address}</b>

You can also save webpages to your <a href="wtv-favorite:/favorite">Favorites</a>, as well as join <a href="wtv-news:/lobby">discussion groups on usenet</a>!

To report trouble of any kind please contact <b>${service_owner_contact}</b> via <b>${service_owner_contact_method}</b>.
